fef (for-each-file)

This is a command-line tool for listing and/or
doing operations on multiple files.
fef can recursively traverse within directory trees.
It can be considered as an alternative to the
classical 'find' command which exists in unix-like systems.

fef: a tool for doing operations on each file within the specified directories
Written by Nihat Engin Toklu < https://github.com/engintoklu > , 03 Oct 2014

Usage:
  fef <options> <directory1> <directory2> ... <directoryN> <expression1> <expression2> ... <expressionN>
where
  <directory>s specify where the <expression>s will be executed.
    If omitted, the operation directory is assumed as the
    current directory(.) .
  <option>s can be omitted, or can be:
    -r or -R    Recursion option. The <expression>s will be executed
                in the subdirectories of the specified <directory>s
  <expression>s are the commands which will be executed on each file
    within the specified <directory>s.
    The expressions will be executed in the specified order
    If an expression returns logical false, the rest of the expressions
    will be canceled for the file being processed.
    An expression is written in this form:
      [ command argument1 argument2 ... argumentN ]
    Expressions can also include sub-expressions.
    (i.e. a sub-expression can be used as an argument):
      [ command1 [ command2 arguments ] ]
    While using this program from a sh-compatible shell,
    you will have to use quotations to prevent the shell from
    interpreting the wildcards.
    Here is an example shell line which will make fef
    show the files with the names matching the pattern '*.txt' :
      fef [ iname '*.txt' ] [ print ]
